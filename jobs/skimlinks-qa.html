        <h1>About&nbsp;Skimlinks</h1>
<p>Skimlinks is an award-winning, mature tech startup headquartered in London and an office in San Francisco. We are known for having disrupted the online content monetization space and have become leaders in the industry. We deliver tools, technology and services that allow online publishers (blogs/ websites/ forums) to earn some serious cash from their content. We work with thousands of publishers globally and make their lives easier by automating their affiliate marketing&nbsp;activities.</p>
<h1>About the&nbsp;Role</h1>
<p>Skimlinks is growing fast and we are looking for an experienced <span class="caps">QA</span> Engineer / Web Test Engineer to join our team in London. You will be responsible for end-to-end testing and quality assurance for every product and interface across the Skimlinks platform. This testing will be predominantly manual initially but will move to automation in the&nbsp;short-term.</p>
<h3>Some of the key responsibilities will&nbsp;be:</h3>
<ul>
<li>Testing all aspects of a web service, from back-end databases, scripts and code modules, to front-end design, usability, and interaction&nbsp;design.</li>
<li>Testing functionality and usability of all front-end systems including user reporting and admin interfaces and any other user-facing systems we&nbsp;develop.</li>
<li>Identify, create and execute functional tests and test scenarios for validating performance against&nbsp;requirements.</li>
<li>Develop test data, execute test scripts and analyse results on testing of all aspects of our web application and&nbsp;APIs.</li>
<li>Develop, execute and maintain <span class="caps">SQL</span> queries to validate completeness, integrity and accuracy of data on the&nbsp;backend.</li>
<li>Design and develop automated solutions to increase the efficiency of testing&nbsp;processes.</li>
<li>Track, plan and coordinate the resolution of bugs, issues and improvements to ensure defect assignments are resolved within a timely&nbsp;manner.</li>
<li>Provide and manage Sprint <span class="caps">QA</span> task estimations within a scrum/agile&nbsp;team.</li>
<li>Document and communicate project status and complex issues effectively to team members and&nbsp;stakeholders.</li>
<li>Create and maintain a virtualized <span class="caps">QA</span> environment to ensure the Skimlinks platform continues to operate with all combinations of browsers, operating systems, plug-ins, ISPs, and anti-virus / phishing&nbsp;solutions.</li>
<li>Review product specifications to provide feedback based on usability, feasibility, and&nbsp;complexity.</li>
<li>Help define and establish new methodologies, processes, and best&nbsp;practices.</li>
</ul>
<h1>About&nbsp;you</h1>
<p>Here at Skimlinks we value dedication, enthusiasm, and a love of innovation. We are disrupting the online monetization industry, and welcome candidates who want to be a part of this ambitious journey. But its not just hard work, we definitely appreciate a bit of quirkiness and fun along the&nbsp;way.</p>
<ul>
<li>You will have a technical degree, such as Computer Science, <span class="caps">IT</span> or&nbsp;similar.</li>
<li>You show strong attention to detail and are able to handle multiple tasks at the same&nbsp;time.</li>
<li>You are happy to perform manual testing for the next 6 months but have a passion for pushing us into automation after&nbsp;that.</li>
<li>You have experience in web testing, <span class="caps">API</span> testing and ensuring the quality of customer-facing web application&nbsp;front-ends.</li>
<li>You will find it important to share knowledge across the team while also learning from&nbsp;others.</li>
<li>You have excellent problem solving abilities and analytical&nbsp;skills.</li>
<li>You are passionate about working with a team to find the best way to test new&nbsp;technologies.</li>
<li>You are passionate about web applications and have an eye for design and&nbsp;usability.</li>
<li>You have a sense of humour, are ambitious, and you love the thrill and madness of working in a start-up&nbsp;environment.</li>
<li>You have a knowledge of Selenium (or equivalent), Python, <span class="caps">PHP</span>, JavaScript, MySQL, <span class="caps">GIT</span> and other open source&nbsp;tools.</li>
</ul>
